Kaiser Permanente(KP) is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity 
and improve healthy habits. 
The overall goal of this project is to improve patient satisfaction and wellbeing, the specific financial goal is to reduce cost by emphasizing 
improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes.
The responsibility of the PM on this team is to research the potential costs, features and benefits of a mobile application that communicates 
with KP patients and helps them improve on healthy habits.
