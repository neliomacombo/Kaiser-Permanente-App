# Kaiser-Permanente-App

Hi, I am glad to share my Nanodegree Project about Kaiser Permanente, a company that is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity and improve on healthy habits. It has been a great learning journey for the last 4 months. I started the jurney with a basic knowledge of the product management roles, but now, I can say that I understand the various organizational functions and how multidisciplinary this position is.
Through the program, I learned to:
1.	Develop and Pitch a product vision;
2.	Run a design sprint;
3.	Manage a product development process;
4.	Create the Go To Market plan to launch the product;
